[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is an easy way to quickly generate, publish and host static pages for you and your project, for free, with GitHub.

This service maps a custom domain to your GitHub pages. The custom domain feature is available for free for any GitHub account.

GitHub supports two type of pages: user or organization pages and per-project pages. You can create pages using the automatic generator, manually pushing html pages or a Jekyll site.
